            Hello! Nice to meet you! My name is Christian Ong! A bit about myself, I am currently 22 years old (yes an 'unc' to a few). I am graduating after this semester! I am currently studying computer science but I am planning to pursue financial advising so hit me up if you want to learn how to invest :D

        <p2>
            My goal for choosing financial advising over a computer science job is to live a life where I can have passive income but also be in a career where I help people! Outside of work/career goals, I enjoying playinf board games and video games. Either strategy board games or fighting videogames!
